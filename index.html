    <p class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-body-tertiary rounded">"When I needed to travel for work, I was worried about leaving my collie, Bertie, alone. I wanted to find a pet care service that would cater to his specific needs and preferences. That's when I discovered Pawmium, the premium bespoke service for pets. Pawmium matched Bertie with a dedicated carer, who took care of him as if he was their own. They provided him with customized walks, grooming, and playtime, according to his personality and energy level. They also kept me updated with frequent photos and messages of Bertie, showing me how much fun he was having. Bertie enjoyed his stay with Pawmium so much that he did not want to come home when I returned. He was so attached to his carer, who clearly adored him too. I am so grateful to Pawmium for providing such a high-quality and personalized service for my furry friend. Pawmium is the best choice for anyone who wants to pamper their pet with the best care possible. Thank you, Pawmium, for making Bertie happy!" - Kate, Coventry

      <p class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-body-tertiary rounded">"Lolly, has always been a nervous and anxious dog. She would bark at strangers, hide under the bed, and refuse to eat when I was away. I was worried about leaving her alone for a long weekend, so I searched for a pet care service that could help her cope with her anxiety. Pawmium assigned Lolly a special carer, who understood her needs and preferences. They provided her with soothing music, aromatherapy, and gentle massages, to calm her down and make her feel safe. They also gave her plenty of exercise, toys, and treats, to keep her entertained and happy. Lolly had a wonderful time with Pawmium, and seeing her relaxed and happy enabled me to relax and enjoy my time away.  I am so thankful to Pawmium for providing such a high-quality and personalized service for my anxious dog. Pawmium is the best choice for anyone who wants to help their pet overcome their fears and enjoy their stay. Thank you for helping Lolly and I relax!" - Fearne, Bristol
