## User Stories

As a static website the user goals will be the same for first time users and returning users. 

**Target Audience**

Pawmium is aimed at pet owners who want to go the extra mile for their dog. Pawmium's premium services are aimed towards animal lovers who have a strong bond with their dog and find it difficult to go away without knowing their dog is getting five star care. Pawmium also provides bespoke events for dog owners that want to have a special celebration for their pup or premium classes to give their pup more mental stimulation.

**User Goals**

* Pawmium aims for potential customers to immediately get a sense that Pawmium offers premium and customisable services. The content used on the website is clear and concise and aims to quickly put across to the user what Pawmium does. The design of the site aims to convey the luxuriousness of the services Pawmium offers by using a classic colour pallette, good quality images and a simple and elegant layout.

* Pawmium aims to get the potential customer to the "get in touch" page and to fill out the contact us form as soon as possible. The website has multiple call out buttons, one the homepage sends the user to the services page and one on the services page which leads the user to the "get in touch" page.

## Design

## Colour Scheme

The colour scheme used is simple to provide a classic, elegant look and to allow the images on the site to pop more:

![#000000 Color Hex Black](assets/images/hex-col-3.png)

![#ffffff Color Hex White](assets/images/hex-col-1.png)

![#dfd9d9 Color Hex](assets/images/hex-col-2.png)

## Typography

![Image of the font chosen for the site](assets/images/lora-font.png)

I chose the Google Font 'Lora' because I believe it is both visibily appealing and also clear and concise. I believe this combination fits well with the elegant theme of the site.
