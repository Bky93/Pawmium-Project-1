## About this site
Pawmium is a premium dog care service for those looking to ensure their dog has the best possible care, whether it be making sure their dog is looked after in luxurious whilst their owner is away or looking to plan a celebration for their four-legged friend. Pawmium offers a multitude of services with the added benefit that every service offered can be personalised to meet the individual needs of each dog and owner.
This website aims to guide the potential customer around the services Pawmium provides with the end result of being guided to the "get in touch" page to contact Pawmium with their enquiry so that Pawmium can get in contact with them to discuss it. The website was designed to ensure Pawmium is viewed as a premium service, this was also taken into account when the decision was made to not include pricing for standard, non-bespoke services. The website was also made to look professional and relatively minimalistic to ensure the end user fills in the contact form on the "get in touch" page. This website has also been made responsive for various screen sizes to ensure a consisent and positive user experience.

## User Stories
As a static website the user goals will be the same for first time users and returning users. 

**Target Audience**
Pawmium is aimed at pet owners who want to go the extra mile for their dog. Pawmium's premium services are aimed towards animal lovers who have a strong bond with their dog and find it difficult to go away without knowing their dog is getting five star care. Pawmium also provides bespoke events for dog owners that want to have a special celebration for their pup or premium classes to give their pup more mental stimulation.

**User Goals**
* Pawmium aims for potential customers to immediately get a sense that Pawmium offers premium and customisable services. The content used on the website is clear and concise and aims to quickly put across to the user what Pawmium does. The design of the site aims to convey the luxuriousness of the services Pawmium offers by using a classic colour pallette, good quality images and a simple and elegant layout.

* Pawmium aims to get the potential customer to the "get in touch" page and to fill out the contact us form as soon as possible. The website has multiple call out buttons, one the homepage sends the user to the services page and one on the services page which leads the user to the "get in touch" page.

* The Pawmium website aims to be user friendly and visibly appealing on all devices. Media queries have been used to give the user good visbility of the site content on different devices.

## Design
## Colour Scheme
The colour scheme used is simple to provide a classic, elegant look and to allow the images on the site to pop more:

![#000000 Color Hex Black](assets/images/hex-col-3.png)

![#ffffff Color Hex White](assets/images/hex-col-1.png)

![#dfd9d9 Color Hex](assets/images/hex-col-2.png)

## Typography
![Image of the font chosen for the site](assets/images/lora-font.png)

I chose the Google Font 'Lora' because I believe it is both visibily appealing and also clear and concise. I believe this combination fits well with the elegant theme of the site.

## Features
**Nav Bar**

	The nav bar used is from Bootstrap and is consistent in all pages. It is responsive and turns into a hamburger menu icon when being viewed on a smaller screen size. The page in the menu the user is hovering their mouse over will change font colour to reflect this. The font colour will also change to show which page the user is currently on. I opted to include the company name and a paw icon taken from font awesome (https://fontawesome.com/icons) which looked more visually appealing than including a custom logo.

#### Web/wider screen view:

**Landing page**

The landing page has been designed to capture the user's attention on first view by using a large hero image and call out. The call out contains a button that leads the user to the services page. The purpose of using this call out is to guide users through the website clearly and quickly as once they reach the services page this is again repeated to send the user to the get in touch page.
All images used on the landing page have been taken from pexels (https://www.pexels.com/) and all icons used have been taken from font awesome (https://fontawesome.com/icons). I used bootstrap to provide the shadow effect seen on the homepage and opted to keep the main colours of the page very basic and use bright and appealing images to provide the colour variety of the page, I believe this makes the web page look tasteful.

**Services Page**

The services page has been designed in a minimalistic way to ensure the services on offer are clear and concise and the hero image and call out catch the user's eye on first glance, leading them to the contact us page.
The hero image has been taken from pexels (https://www.pexels.com/). I used bootstrap to provide the shadow effect seen on the page.

**Contact page**
The contact page has been designed to appear clean, clear and concise with the aim for the user to fill out the contact us form. Once the user clicks submit on the contact us form they will be re-directed to the thank you page. The page also contains a map containing a pin where Pawmium's head office is. The map was added by using an iFrame link from Google Maps.

**Thank you page**
The user reaches the thank you page once they click submit on the contact us form. The thank you page is very basic and has been specifically designed this way to persuade the user to browse the rest of the site.

## Future Implementations
In future versions of this site I would like to add animation so the sections of the pages slide into view as the user scrolls. I would also like to add a section on nutrition containing videos made by Pawmium.
## Accessibility
I have used alt attributes for all images on the website and aria labels. I have also used back up fonts and

The W3C CSS validation service found 1 error as seen in the image above. I removed this line of css and found the site was not effected.

I also removed the css line that was flagged up in the warnings and found this did not effect the site.

I then checked it again and the validator confirmed there was no longer any errors:
